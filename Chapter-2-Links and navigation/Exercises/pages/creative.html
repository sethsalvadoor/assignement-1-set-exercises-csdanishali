        <h2>Cast and Creative Team</h2>
        <p>The original Ragnarok Online was developed by Gravity Co., Ltd., and the mobile reincarnation is brought to you by Gravity Game Tech, in partnership with X.D. Global. The character designs still hold true to the vision of Lee Myung-jin, the Korean manhwa artist whose comic "Ragnarok" inspired the entire franchise. While individual developers are not heavily spotlighted, the creative team remains deeply rooted in the original design philosophy: cuteness, chaos, and copious amounts of grinding.</p>
        <p>Voice acting is minimal or region-specific, and the localization team deserves a shoutout for managing to translate fantasy gobbledygook into at least semi-coherent English.</p>
